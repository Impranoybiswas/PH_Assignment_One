              As for the year that is winding down, it was neither an
              overarching triumph nor a debilitating failure. The stench of
              mediocrity was present, but so was vivacious tenacity. Above all,

              Till the 80th minute, the scores were tied at a goal each. Both
              Bangladesh and Nepal fought brilliantly till that point; however,
              after Nepal equalized, they began to pose more of a threat in the
              attacking third. Two attacks from Sabitra Bhandari exposed
              Bangladesh's deteriorating physicality, but somehow they held on.
              Then, a quick throw-in changed everything.
